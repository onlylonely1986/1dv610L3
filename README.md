Project folder for Lab 3, in course 1dv610

If you download the application and want to use it. Check settings.php.default and update it with your own variables for databaseconnection. Then change the name to setting.php. You can than run it either at own host online, or thrue for example XXAMP.

This is project folder for a php-project witch you can use to register and login new users. When you are logged in you can post small scribbles (short text-posts, like notes or thoughts). You can also read other scribbles from other users, but you are only allowed to remove your own posts.

The application has some bugs and problems. In source code I have added TODO comments where I think it is problems that should be solved in next iteration.

You can run the application online at: http://l3test.lonenilsson.com/

You can also test the application against automatic tests at http://csquiz.lnu.se:25083/index.php (fill in the username Admin and Password as username and Password and put in xx00xx as lnu username. 

If I remove the scribblepart from application the tests show up 77%, but I have not any more time to solve the possible problem with DOM, I think the autotests react on anything in the HTML. An other solution should maybe be to put each component in separate systems and use them together as a whole.
